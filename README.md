# Countdown_timer for Problem solving strategy

## Django and Python

A countdown timer as a web terminal which will give 20 mins to analyze the problem and code.<br/>
If it was not done in 20 mins then it will keep adding 20 mins until the problem has been finished (maximum 2 times).<br/>
If not done by that time, it will add 10 mins to copy the code to integrate in self code.
